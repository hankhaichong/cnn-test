# cnn-test
This is an implementation progress CNN using numpy after learning the theories and operations mainly via CS231N 2016 and reading blog posts. 

### Current status
IN PROGRESS for v0.1

### Objectives
#### v0.1
1. To get a better understanding of the operations behind a CNN.
2. To get used to slicing and indexing high dimensional numpy arrays.
3. To refresh and get the intuition behind backpropagation in neural network to easier debug network in the future.
#### Future versions
1. To get used to writing efficient and productionable python code.
2. To understand more recently developed layers and activation functions and why they work well.
3. To appreciate the importance of using different optimizers and weight initialization techniques.

### TODO:
#### v0.1
1. Include padding and striding in convolution and maxpool layer.
2. Include a small demo on CIFAR 10 and MNIST dataset.
3. Explain the thought process behind each of the steps and functions.
#### Future versions
1. To modularize the layers.
2. Include layers like batchnorm.
3. Include other activation functions like ELU, Leaky RELU.
4. Include different types of optimizers.
5. Different types of weight initialization.
6. Demo and benchmark on experiments using different activation functions, optimizers and weight initialization.
